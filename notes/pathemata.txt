Pathemata or pathe (Plato, in the Timaeus at least, uses these terms interchangeably) play an important role in the process eventuating in aisthesis. ``Pathemata'' is perhaps most naturally translated in English as affections. In a not quite archaic usage, affections are conditions or characteristics of a thing brought about by its being affected in some way. But the pathemata that play a role in the causal process eventuating in perception or sensation in Timaeus' account are a specification of the more generic account provided by the natural English translation. It is surprisingly controversial, however, what, exactly, ``pathemata'' means in this context. Thus Taylor (1928, 429-31) understands the pathemata, in this context, as sensible qualities that a thing may have independently of the sensibility of a percipient being affected in any way. They are ``characters of the various bodies themselves'' as opposed to ``the effects produced by the bodies on a percipient''. Cornford (1937, 258-9), by contrast, wants to assimilate Timaeus' account of perception to the account given in the Theaetetus. As a result, he contrasts the pathemata with those ``properties which bodies are supposed to possess in the absence of any sentient being, such as the shapes of the microscopic particles, which are never perceived'' (cornford, 1937, 259); for, according to the Secret Doctrine that Socrates attributes to Protagoras in the Theaetetus 156a-b, a sensible quality and a perceiver's perception of it are ``twin births'' with the consequence that nothing is white without a perception of that whiteness. Since it is controversial how to understand pathemata in this context, it is worth discussing this explicitly before discussing Timaeus' specific examples of pathemata that eventuate in perception or sensation.

Timaeus distinguishes two classes of pathemata. There are:

	1. pathemata that are common to the body as a whole (Timaeus 61d--65b)
	2. pathemata that perculiar to particular parts of the body (Timaeus 65b--68e)

The body, here, is the human body, the body of a sentient being. This is inconsistent with Taylor's (1928, 431) denial that the pathemata are ``the effects produced by the bodies on a percipient''. In describing the common pathemata, Tiameus' explicit task is to describe the affections of the body as a whole and the names of the agents that produce these affections (Timaeus 65b). Timaeus undertakes a similar task with the peculiar pathemata, that is, he is meant to describe the affections of particular parts of the body and the names of the agents that produce these affections. Since the agents that produce these affections, whether common or peculiar, are the objects of perception, this is inconsistent with Taylor and Cornford's common insistence that the pathemata are sensible qualities. And this reamins so whether or not sensible qualities are best conceived, in Timaeus' account, as characteristics of bodies had independently of their effects on perceivers or as twinned with the appropriate perception. 

Pathemata are not the objects of perception as Taylor and Cornford maintain but, rather, they are a causal intermediary between the objects of perception and the perceptions or sensations that they are liable to give rise to.
