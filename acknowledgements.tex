Thanks to Niels Christensen for a revealing conversation about the potential intertextual significance of the etymologies of the \emph{Cratylus}.

Thanks to Justin Broackes for a conversation in Cambridge about \emph{diaphanē} in Aristotle which I found fruitful in application to the Timaean account of transparency.

Thanks to Gábor Betegh for a useful conccersation about the impurity of the human soul's composition.

Material from chapter~\ref{sec:the_eyes} was the basis of a talk delivered at the University of Helsinki. Thanks to the audience on that occasion for the opportunity to discuss this with them. Their questions and comments proved very useful. And special thanks to Jos\'{e} Filipe Silva for the invitation and continued discussion of these and related matters in the history of philosophy of perception.
