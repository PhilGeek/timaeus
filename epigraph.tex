\epigraph{The development of consciousness in human beings is inseparably connected with the use of metaphor. Metaphors are not merely peripheral decorations or even useful models, they are fundamental forms of our awareness of our condition: metaphors of space, metaphors of movement, metaphors of vision.}{Iris Murdoch, \emph{The Sovereignty of Good}}
\epigraph{Due to being confused here, I have become a seeker of the secret.}{Farīdu'd-Dīn `Aṭṭār, \emph{Manṭiqu'ṭ-Ṭair}}
