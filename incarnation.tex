\section{Cosmic and Encosmic Incarnation} % (fold)
\label{sec:cosmic_and_encosmic_incarnation}

There are similarities between cosmic and encosmic incarnation. The generation of the Cosmos and its ensoulment and the generation of the human body and its ensoulment are in many ways similar. But, importantly, there are differences. 

First, there is a difference in agency. Whereas, the Demiurge generates the body of the Cosmos and the soul that animates it, the young gods, generated by the Demiurge, act on His behest in generating the human body. At least the immortal part of the soul is generated by the Demiurge with similar materials, if less pure, than the materials from which the World-Soul was generated. The difference in agency is explained by the limitations of the young gods' power of generation. In generating mortal living beings, the young gods imitate Demiurgic activity. Their imitation is imperfect, however. Whereas the Demiurge generates immortals, the young gods generate only mortals. This is precisely why they are assigned this task. In order for a sensible living being to be truly comprehensive, it must contain within itself all manner of mortal living beings. 

Second, there is a difference in body. The bodies of mortal living beings are importantly different from the body of the Cosmos that contains them. Mortal living beings contained within the Cosmos are situated in an environment with strong powers. The Cosmos, by contrast, is not situated in an environment. There is nothing beyond the limits of the Cosmos, neither strong powers, nor space, nor void. Mortal living beings depend upon and must defend against the environment and consequently have a number of powers that are only ever exercised in an environment. That mortal living beings are equipped with the instruments of these powers explains the way their bodies differ from the body of the Cosmos.

Third, there is a difference in soul. The human soul has mortal and immortal parts. While the young gods generate the mortal part of the soul, the Demiurge generates the immortal part from the same material, if less pure, that He used to generate the World-Soul. Like the World-Soul, it is composed of the Circles of the Same and the Different, and though Timaeus does not say so explicitly, presumably the immortal part of the human soul is structured in the same way with arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic intervals. However, whereas the motions of the World-Soul are unwaverable, the motions of the immortal part of the human soul are waverable, they may be affected by strong powers in the sensible environment. Moreover, unlike the Cosmos, human beings have, in addition, mortal parts of the soul. That mortal living beings are situated in an environment with strong powers explains why their souls have mortal parts and why the motions of their soul may waver.

Fourth, soul and body are differently related. The World-Soul encompasses the body of the Cosmos. Though some commentators may try to resist it, Timaeus spatial language is clear. The body of the Cosmos is contained within the World-Soul. The immortal part of the human soul, by contrast, is encompassed by the human body. The immortal part of the soul is contained within the human body. It is bound to the marrow that composes the brain which is encased in the skull which is itself covered by flesh and hair. Just as the flesh protects the skull that it contains, providing padding that will soften any blow that may befall it, the skull protects the brain that it contains and so preserves its bond with the immortal part of the soul. In this way, the body is organized so as to protect its bond with the immortal soul that it contains and that animates it. Mortal living beings are situated within the immortal Cosmos in the way that the Cosmos is not. That mortal living beings are situated in an environment with strong powers explains how their soul and body are differently related.

Fifth, there is a difference in narrative order. Timaeus narrates the generation of the body of the Cosmos before narrating how it became ensouled. This narrative is reversed when it comes to the generation of human beings. Timaeus narrates the incarnation of the human soul before narrating the generation of the human body. This narrative reversal is accompanied by a perspectival shift. Timaeus narrates the incarnation of the human soul from the perspective of the human soul, the dramatic highpoint of which is Timaeus vivid description of the shock of embodiment. The ensoulment of the body of the Cosmos, by contrast, is impersonally presented. This perspectival shift is ethically significant. In dramatizing the shock of embodiment undergone by a newly incarnate human soul, Timaeus makes vivid the need for salvation, thus laying the groundwork for his soteriology (chapter~\ref{cha:the_end_of_vision_and_audition}).

The present chapter will follow the order in which Timaeus narrates the incarnation of the human soul and the generation of the human body. The differences highlighted above shall be further explained and their significance assessed (all but one---the mortal soul shall be discussed in chapter~\ref{cha:the_flesh_and_the_mortal_soul}). Just as the Cosmos lacks certain features since it lacks an environment, mortal living beings have certain features since they are situated in an environment with strong powers that they depend upon and must defend against. Again, the principle lesson for the philosophy of perception shall be the environmental nature of perception. Sensory powers are only ever exercised on aspects of the sensible environment in which the percipient is situated.

\section{The Demiurge's Address} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_demiurge_addressing_the_gods}

The Demiurge addresses two classes of gods. Specifically, the Demiurge addresses, on the one hand, the gods that manifestly revolve (celestial bodies such as the fixed stars) and, on the other hand, the gods that manifest themselves at will (the Titanic and Olympian gods familiar from the poets and state religion). The young gods are the instruments of Demiurgic activity, and the Demiurge, in his address, reveals both his intentions, and the reason for the involvement of the young gods in carrying out His intentions.

The address itself divides into three parts:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item A discussion on the nature of bonds forms the basis of the assurance that the Demiurge gives the young gods. Though not wholly immortal, they need not fear death, since only what is evil would undo the bonds of what is well-fitted and good.
	\item The Demiurge instructs the young gods to generate the three remaining kinds of mortal beings. This they must do, since the Demiurge can only generate immortal beings, and mortal beings are required to complete the Cosmos conceived as a comprehensive sensible living being.
	\item The Demiurge explains that his role in the generation of mortal beings will be limited to generating the immortal part and instructs the young gods to weave what is mortal into what is immortal.
\end{enumerate}


(1) The Demiurge's discussion of bonds (\emph{desm≈ç}) has antecedents in Timaeus' speech, specifically in the proportionate bonds that unite the opposed extremes of fire and earth in amity in the body of the Cosmos. The young gods, like the body of the Cosmos, are compounded. And what unites the constituents of the compound into a whole are bonds. Though the Demiurge does not say, presumably these are proportionate bonds. After all, the fairest bond that most perfectly unites what it joins is proportion (\emph{analogia}, 31c2--4). 

What are united by the bonds that generate the young gods? \citet[]{Taylor:1928qb} discerns two models. What is united by bonds is either the materials that are combined in the generation of their soul, or what is united by bonds is their soul and their body. Timaeus does not explicitly opt for one or the other of these models.

The first thing that the Demiurge does is explicitly state a principle that may be cause for concern, at least for any young god that may fear death. All that are joined together by bonds may be undone. This is the reason that the young gods are not wholly immortal and indissoluble. Corresponding to Taylor's two models for what are united by the bonds that generate the young gods are two models of their death. Death is an undoing of what has been bound in generation, and since the two models differ in what has been bound in generation, they yield different models of death. On the first model, the undoing of the young gods is the dissolution of their soul into the constituents that entered into their mixture. Soul, recall, is generated from a mixture of indivisible and divisible Being, Sameness, and Difference. Should the Demiurge, \emph{per impossibile}, undo the soul of a young god, the one would dissolve again into the many. On the second model, the undoing of the young gods is the dissolution of their soul-body union, the separation of the soul from the body that it animated. On the second model, the separation of the soul from the body that it animates is straightforwardly a kind of death since the soul, in being separated, no longer animates the body. What was once living is now dead. 

The young gods are not wholly immortal. The qualifier ``wholly'' already hints at Demiurgic assurance. After all, not being wholly immortal is consistent with being partly immortal. His assurance consists in the claim that only what is evil would undo the bonds of what is well-fitted and good. That principle only constitutes an assurance against the background of two further assumptions. First, that the young gods are well-fitted and good. For if they are not, the principle does not say that it would be evil to undo that which is ill-fitted and bad, and so no assurance would be given. Second, that the Demiurge, as the maker of these bonds, is not evil. The Demiurge is benevolent and ungrudging. He is overflowing with goodness and not at all evil. 

There is a further implicit commitment here, namely, that only the Demiurge has the power to undo the bonds by which the young gods were compounded. For suppose this power was not the Demiurge's alone. Then some other agent could be the cause of their undoing. Even if the Demiurge, being benevolent and ungrudging, shall not undo the bonds that join them, some other agent may yet exercise this power should they be suitably evil. This last implicit commitment was earlier made explicit in Timaeus discussion of the elemental composition of the body of the Cosmos (32c3--5) and will be made explicit again in Timaeus' warning that it is impious to empirically investigate color mixture. Only God is wise enough and powerful enough to blend the many into one and dissolve the one into many (68c7‚Äìd7).

The Demiurge ends this portion of his address with a hyperbolic claim that should be understood as the expression of His overflowing goodness. The Demiurge is benevolent and ungrudging and would not will the undoing of what is well-fitted and good. The Demiurge now represents his will has a greater bond than what bound them in generation. By Timaeus' lights at least, this Demiurgic claim is hyperbolic. Again, he has explicitly stated that the fairest bond that most perfectly unites what it joins is proportion (\emph{anologia}, 31c2--4). If the Demiruge's will is greater still, does that not mean that the bond that it constitutes is fairer and more perfectly unites what it joins? If so, the Timaean principle is false. The hyperbole is not a false boast, nor meant to mislead, but rather dramatizes the benevolent and ungrudging nature of the Demiurge whose overflowing goodness is the real guarantee of the immortality of the young gods. 

(2) In the second part of His address, the Demiurge instructs the young gods to generate the three remaining kinds of mortal beings. The Demiurge does not simply command them to do so, but explains why He needs them to fullfil His intentions. The young gods are rational participants in cooperative Demiurgic activity.

According to Timaeus, the Cosmos contains four kinds of living beings:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item the young gods
	\item the beings that live in the air
	\item the beings that live in the water
	\item the beings that live on the earth
\end{enumerate}
Notice how the three remaining kinds of mortal beings are correlated with primary bodies. Specifically, the three kinds of mortal beings are the kinds of living beings that live in the region of the air, water, or earth, respectively. These regions are determined by the winnowing motion of the Receptacle which sorts the primary bodies, like by like, into different regions of the Cosmos. Thus whereas earth tends to accumulate at the center of the Cosmos, fire tends to accumulate at the circumference. And the kinds of mortal beings are determined by their suitability to reside in these regions. The young gods themselves are not explicitly correlated with a primary body, but an implicit correlation is not far to seek. The primary body not explicitly mentioned is fire. Moreover, fire tends to naturally accumulate at the circumference of the Cosmos. And it is in the circumference of the Cosmos where the fixed stars reside. There are, of course, young gods positioned below the fixed stars. But it is plausible to suppose that all the young gods are at least superlunary. Even if the Olympian gods are capable of manifesting themselves at will in the sublunary ream, they naturally reside above.

The Cosmos as a whole is a sensible living being. Moreover, it is a comprehensive sensible living being. That is to say that the Cosmos is a sensible living being that contains within itself all other sensible living beings. In this way it better resembles the Paradigm, the Living Being. The Paradigm is an intelligible living being. Moreover, it is a comprehensive intelligible living being. It contains within itself all other intelligible living beings. But to be truly comprehensive and so better resemble the Living Being, the Cosmos must contain within itself all kinds of sensible living beings. So the comprehensiveness of the Cosmos is only perfected by the activity of the young gods at behest of the Demiurge.

Thus far in the narrative, the Demiurge has generated immortal beings (even if not wholly immortal). Indeed, given that his power is the expression of His overflowing goodness, He is only capable of generating immortals. But to be truly comprehensive, the Cosmos must contain within itself the three kinds of mortal living beings. It is for this reason that the Demiurge assigns this task to the young gods. The young gods shall do so by imitating Demiurgic activity. However, the imitation is imperfect. While the young gods are capable of generating living beings, these will be mortal. The irony here should be evident. Imperfect mimetic activity is required to complete and so perfect the Cosmos.

(3) Mortal beings, or at least some of them, shall have a part that deserves to be called ``immortal''. This part the Demiurge Himself shall generate. And with respect to the human soul, the Demiurge shall generate it in a way that parallels his generation of the World-Soul. The human soul too shall be a mixture, though less pure, of indivisible and divisible Being, Sameness, and Difference. Moreover, it too shall be fashioned into the Circles of the Same and the Different. The young gods task is to generate the specifically mortal parts of these living beings, borrowing corporeal material from the body of the Cosmos itself to which it shall return once the mortal being perishes. Moreover, the Demiurge instructs the young gods to weave the mortal parts into the mortal parts. So the young gods task is not only to generate the mortal parts of sensible living beings but to join these through weaving to the immortal parts that the Demiurge Himself generated.

Completing and so perfecting the Cosmos is thus not a task that the Demiurge simply leaves to the young gods. Since even mortal living beings have immortal parts, and these can only be generated by the Demiurge, the completion and perfection of the Cosmos is a coordinated activity of the Demiruge and the young gods acting on His behest. And as this coordinated activity is rational, the Demiurge has explained not only his intentions but the reasons for the involvement of the young gods in fullfiling them.

\section{The Immortal Part} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_immortal_part}

Having addressed the young gods, and explained his intentions and the resons for his involvement of the young gods in completing and so perfecting the Cosmos, the Demiurge immediately turns to his own role in the generation of the three kinds of mortal beings. Specifically, the Demiurge sets about generating the immortal part of mortal beings. 

The immortal part of mortal beings is the soul, or at least the immortal part of the soul. This is generated in a parallel fashion to the generation of the World-Soul. Indeed the Demiurge works with the same materials and instruments. Thus into the \emph{kratƒìr} (be it a mixing bowl or a crucible) wherein the Demiruge mixed the World-Soul, he poured the remaining material. The World-Soul was a mixture of indivisible and divisible Being, Sameness, and Difference. The residue of these are now mixed in the \emph{kratƒìr} in the same manner. Presumably, Timaeus means, among other things, that they are mixed in the same proportions. There is, however, a crucial difference, the present mixture lacks the uniform and invariable purity of the World-Soul. As Timaeus elaborates for emphasis, it is a second or third degree of purity. 

I am unsure what Timaeus so much as could mean by purity. On the most straightforward understanding, the mixture would be pure if it consisted solely of indivisible and divisible Being, Sameness, and Difference. And it would be impure if it contained, in addition, some other material. But what other materials? (Rest and Motion?) It is hard to understand Timaeus' talk of purity in terms of the absence of the alien. So what could purity here amount to? Perhaps it is a matter of the exactness of proportion with which these materials are mixed. That would avoid the previous difficulty, but the problem is that balance and harmony are not purity, even in an extended sense of purity. 

While it is unclear what exactly Timaeus means by purity here, the consequences of impurity are clear. The human soul is like the World-Soul in its composition and mixture. They are generated from the same materials and mixed in the same proportions. The human soul is unlike the World-Soul in being less pure, indeed to a second or third degree. The World-Soul is thus prior not only in birth but in dignity. The generation of the World-Soul is temporally prior to the generation of the human soul and so prior in birth. And the World-Soul is generated from a purer mixture of the same materials from which the human soul is mixed and is thus prior in dignity, owing to its more perfect purity. The World-Soul is very much the elder sibling of the human soul. Indeed Plotinus describes them as sisters.

Not only is the human soul like the World-Soul in its composition and mixture, they are also similarly constructed. Just as the Demiurge constructed the Circles of the Same and the Different from the pure mixture from which the World-Soul was generated, the Demiurge constructs the Circles of the Same and the Different from the impure mixture from which the human soul was generated. Timaeus later confirms this in his narrative of the shock of embodiment. Presumably, the Demiurge marks the same geometrical, arithmetical, and harmonic intervals in the human soul as he did in the World-Soul, though given the impurity, perhaps less precisely. Presumably, as well, just as the revolutions of the Circles of the Same and the Different determine the kinaesthetic and cognitive powers of the World-Soul, the revolutions of the Circles of the Same and the Different determine the kinaesthetic and cognitive powers of the human soul. The human soul is at least capable of operating in alignment with the World-Soul. And it is capable of this since it is generated from the same materials, mixed in the same proportions, and constructed in the same fashion.

The Demiurge divides the mixture into a number of souls equal to the number of stars. The Demiurge then assigns each soul to its own star. Timaeus describes this as each soul being mounted in a vehicle (\emph{ochƒìma}), such as a carriage or perhaps a chariot (as in \emph{Phaedrus} 247b). The souls are mounted there, in the stars, so that the Demiurge may address them, as He explains the Laws of Destiny to them, prior to their incarnation. (Timaeus' talk of soul-vehicles, here, will become a rich vein of psychological speculation for the Neoplatonists, and the Western source for the occult doctrine of astral bodies, see \citealt[appendix 2]{Dodds:1963ul} and \citealt{Finamore:1985aa})

Why should the human soul, in its pre-incarnate state, be assigned to a star and be mounted in it as in a vehicle? After all, there was nothing in which the World-Soul was mounted before it encompassed the body of the Cosmos. If anything, it would be more apt to say that the body of the Cosmos is mounted in the World-Soul as in a vehicle. Like a carriage, the body of the Cosmos is carried within it. Human souls, unlike the World-Soul, are encosmic. After all, the World-Soul is the soul of the Cosmos, not the soul of a sensible living being contained within the Cosmos. Perhaps human souls can only exist within the Cosmos if they are incarnate. The bodies of the stars, when functioning as vehicles for the souls mounted in them, become surrogate bodies of pre-incarnate souls. In being assigned to the stars, human souls in their pre-incarnate state nonetheless secure for themselves a derivative corporeal presence within the Cosmos. 
% On the present speculative suggestion, the principle

Some support for this is given in 44e where Timaeus describes the human body as a vehicle for the soul. In this context, vehicle is meant quite literally as a means of locomotion. Only sensible living beings contained within the Cosmos have space within which to move in the six irrational motions. Only they require a means of locomotion. In this way, they contrast with the Cosmos that contains them, for beyond its limits is neither space nor void in which to irrationally move. The power of locomotion is environmental. It can only ever be exercised in an environment that circumscribes its possessor. And again at 69c, Timaeus describes the young gods as giving to the human soul its body as a vehicle. Though, here, it is unclear whether vehicle is exclusively meant as a means of locomotion.

There are two things that vehicle can mean. On the one hand, it may be a means of locomotion, such as a carriage or chariot, or it may be a bearer. Consider: a vehicle of expression is not a means of locomotion. It may bear what is expressed but it transports it nowhere. Though distinct, these meanings overlap. A means of locomotion may bear what it transports. But a bearer need not transport what it bears. Even in cases where these senses overlap, the conversational focus may be on one or the other. When the Demiurge mounts the pre-incarnate souls in the stars as in vehicles, the souls travel along with the Heavenly revolutions. So their stellar vehicles are a mode of transport. But what is important is their presence within the Cosmos. It is only a corporeal presence within the Cosmos that secures for them a view on its contents and so puts them in an apt position for the Demiurgic address. And a corporeal presence requires a bodily vehicle understood as a bearer rather than a mode of transport, even if it is also a means of locomotion.

That souls can only exist within the Cosmos if they are incarnate (perhaps derivatively, like the souls mounted in their stellar vehicles) potentially bears on the interpretation of the Timaean principle that intellect can only exist in soul, and soul in body. Specifically, it raises the possibility of a restricted reading of that principle. Soul must exist in body only if it exists within the Cosmos. The suggestion is that the principle is restricted to encosmic living beings. So understood, it is consistent with there being intellect without soul, and soul without body. It is just that these lack a corporeal presence and so could not enjoy an encosmic existence. 

Encosmic living beings exist in an environment that circumscribes them, the Cosmos. And in order to exist within that environment, encosmic living beings must be embodied. Timaeus thus postulates a link between embodiment and embeddedness. One must be embodied to be embedded in an environment. Embodiment may be insufficient for being embedded within in environment. The Cosmos is embodied but lacks and environment. But embodiment is necessary for being embedded within an environment. Corporeal presence is required for encosmic existence.

The Demiurge, in assigning each soul to its own star, affords them a Heavenly perspective on the Cosmos, an apt vantage point from which to be instructed as to the nature of the Cosmos and its foreordained laws. They need to be present in the Cosmos in order to have a view on it. In order to present in the Cosmos, they need a corporeal vehicle, even a temporary one. And in order to have an apt vantage point on the contents of the Cosmos, they are mounted in the stars. And presumably, from their stellar vehicles, the perspective of each is directed toward the center of the Cosmos.

\section{The Laws of Destiny} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_laws_of_destiny}

The Demiurgic address, where He explains the Laws of Destiny to the pre-incarnate human souls, is bookended by two phases of a celestial descent. We have already described the first phase of celestial descent, the Demiurge assigning each soul to a star. Notice that the \emph{kratƒìr} in which the souls were mixed is no part of the Cosmos. So when initially generated, the souls have only a hypercosmic existence. They only first appear in the Cosmos when they are mounted in their stars as in vehicles. After the address, prior to being incarnated, the souls will be reassigned to the wanderers. So initially, they are assigned to the fixed stars moving along with the Circle of the Same in the World-Soul. Subsequently, they are reassigned to the wanders moving along with the divided Circle of the Different in the World-Soul. This reassignment is a descent since the fixed stars are at the circumference of the Cosmos, and the wanderers are between the circumference of the Cosmos and its center. The descent ultimately culminates in the soul's incarnation on Earth located at the center of the Cosmos. In the initial phase of the celestial descent, the assignment is one-one, in the subsequent phase, the assignment is one-many. The Moon, for example, will be assigned many souls. In the final phase of descent, in the shock of embodiment, each soul is assigned its own body to animate and the assignment is again one-one.
