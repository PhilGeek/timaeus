\section{The Methodological Dilemma Revisited} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_methodological_dilemma_revisited}

Recall that Timaeus inaugurates his discussion of the \emph{pathēmata} with a methodological dilemma (61c4–d5). The \emph{pathēmata}, affections of the corporeal instruments of \emph{aisthēsis}, are contrasted with two other things. Specifically they are contrasted with the origin of the flesh and things pertaining to it, on the one hand, and the mortal parts of the soul, on the other. The problem is twofold. First, one cannot adequately account for the \emph{pathēmata} having to do with \emph{aisthēsis} without accounting for the origin of the flesh and things pertaining to it and the mortal part of the soul. But second, one cannot account for the origin of the flesh and things pertaining to it and the mortal parts of the soul without accounting for the \emph{pathēmata} having to do with \emph{aisthēsis}. The problem is not one of mutual entailment or that these subject matters somehow presuppose one another directly. The problem is rather that an account of either subject matter each presupposes \emph{aisthēsis} with the consequence that an account of each must make reference to the other. Hence the methodological dilemma: Timaeus cannot account for either without reference to the other, but it is impossible to give an account of both subjects at once. Timaeus solution is to first account for the \emph{pathēmata} (61d–68d) and then subsequently account for the origin of the flesh and things pertaining to it (73b1ff) and the mortal parts of the soul (69c5ff). 

We have already discussed Timaeus' account of the (chapters~\ref{cha:common_pathemata} and \ref{cha:peculiar_pathemata}). In the present chapter we shall discuss the origin of the flesh and things pertaining to it and the mortal parts of the soul. Unfortunately not the whole of it. Our approach will be selective. The selection is subservient to two goals. First, I want to learn what I can about how the methodological dilemma is resolved from this discussion. As audition is the clearest case where further insight is shed on a perceptual power, it is natural, as well, to focus on this. Second, I want to learn what the mortal soul is and how it acts as a principle of vital activity.

Earlier, when I said it was unfortunate that we are not in a position to discuss the whole of Timaeus' account about the origin of the flesh and things pertaining to it and the mortal parts of the soul some may be forgiven for hearing a hint of wry irony. None was intended. The significance of Timaean anatomy is underappreciated. For just consider the context. Socrates the day before has given a speech on the topic of the \emph{Republic} and requests that the return speeches he is now owed portray Socrates' ideal city in action. Critias proposes that a secret history, passed down in his family, of ancient Athenians fighting a war with Atlantis over the Mediterranean would serve this purpose. This history will be delivered only after Timaeus' cosmology. What's the connection? The Cosmos is only completely perfected when there are mortal living beings embodied and embedded within it. Anthropgony is required to perfect the Cosmos by making it better resemble the intelligible Living Being upon which it was modeled. The Living Being is comprehensive. It contains within it all other intelligible living beings. In order for the Cosmos to be comprehensive it must contain within it all other sensible living beings. As a consequence of embodiment, mortal souls not only have an immortal part, which the Demiurge addressed in delivering the Laws of Destiny, but now have a mortal part as well. There are two parts of the mortal soul, the spirited part, and the appetitive part. So Timaeus seems to subscribe to a tripartite psychology, though there are differences between the Timaean account and the accounts found in the \emph{Republic} and the \emph{Phaedo}. Nevertheless, Timaeus retains the city--soul analogy. Moreover, the moral psychology determined by his anthropogony, required for the perfection of the Cosmos, is the moral psychology of the Athenian heroes who staved off the enslavement of the Mediterranean by Atlantis. It is only if the actions of the Athenians are sufficiently like the actions of Socrates' ideal city will the return \emph{logoi} meet with his approval. And in order for Timaeus' speech to contribute to this collective effort, the actions of the Athenian heroes must be explicable in terms of the moral psychology dictated by his anthropogony. And these are bound up with commitments concerning the flesh and the mortal soul.

A vivid example of the ethical significance of Timaean anatomy involves audition. We are providentially provided ears to hear with to correct the revolutions of the immortal soul disrupted as a result of being embodied and embedded in an environment with strong powers and so subject to the irrational linear motion of \emph{aisthēsis}. In listening to music or rational speech with rational attentiveness, the revolutions of the soul have a tendency to align with the revolutions of our elder sister, the World Soul. While we have been told that sound impacts upon the brain and the blood through the ears and causes a motion from the head to the region of the liver, the rational effects of rational attentive listening have yet to be explained. These, however, become explicable once we understand the ethical function of the liver. So our knowledge of Divine Providence is incomplete without detailed anatomical knowledge of the liver.
